savedColors
===========

A place to put colors that I may want to use
I created this little guy when I was learning to use files in php. I wanted to have a page that I could
keep open for when I saw a cool color that I didn't want to forget. I enter the name, hue, and hex value,
and a div is created and the data is saved to a file. The file will be created if it doesn't already exist.
