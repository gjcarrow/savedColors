This is for the tutorial that I am doing to incorporate html, javascript, php, and database parts. It will just be a list of colors with corresponding names, hex codes, and hue. Each color will be the background of a 200x200px div, and the hex code of the color will be the text in the div. Instead of going back to the source file everytime I want to add a new color, I want to make it so I just fill in some fields in a form that is on the page, and the div is made for me and is shown on the page. The database will be a list of all the colors already on the page, so it will need to be checked once I enter a new color,	and updated accordingly. 
It is a simple little app, but I think there is good incorporation of different aspects that will help learn some things by actually having to apply them to a real project. This might even be a good place to incorporate some angular.
